# python_spark
Here are a bunch of mini Python scripts I wrote which use Spark using PySpark.

These scripts assume you're using Python version 3.5.2 and Spark 2.0

To execute the scripts in Spark, do the following:

spark-submit most_popular_superhero.py, for example. Replace the py script name with any of the Python scripts in this repo.
